### Notes

I like the simplicity of this solution. However, I couldn't resist building a somewhat more reusable/configurable option as a gem, which is available in the [proto_gem](https://github.com/heffergm/homework/tree/proto_gem/proto) branch.

### Requirements

- ruby2.4

### Usage

- `bundle install`
- `./proto.rb`

### Lint

- `bundle exec rake`
